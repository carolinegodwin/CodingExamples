# CodingExamples

This repository contains the code from 2 components on a site I have recently been in the process of redesigning - AnimeBento.com. Each component has 2 files, an html and a css, due to the required organization of the framework Cratejoy I am using to design it. Due to this framework, you will see snippets in the code formatted "{settings[.....]}, which are automatically placed in the components by the cratejoy visual design tool. Those lines are not my code!

The Hero - which contains titles, images as backgrounds and featured product, and a javascript countdown timer. I have included this to showcase my ability to create responsive solutions to hero images + their content, as well as to show the implementation of javascript.

The Big Bento component is featured so that you can see my choices for responsive design, as well as my ability to use CSS to complete actions like animation.


I have also included the code to my personal website - a Wordpress site that I developed entirely (front/back end) on my own while I was job hunting! Any shortcodes or formatting in the file cgodwinHome.html is due to the wordpress theme I used, as I just included the HTML I used to create the homepage!


Hope these explainations make sense, let me know if you have any questions or would like to see any more of my code! :)
